# Animal_Shelter_Analysis
This Bootstrap-driven web dashboard-style site provides an analysis of the intake and placement rates at an animal shelter in the Midwestern US.  Data was collected in CSV format and cleaned and processed with Python and Pandas.
 
The following visualizations were created with Matplotlib:

 * Pie charts documenting the intake causes for thousands of animals, as well as their eventual outcome (adoption, release to wild, euthanasia, etc)
 * Bar chart analysis of various demographics within the shelter animal population
 * Bubble chart mapping animal age groups to outcome categories
